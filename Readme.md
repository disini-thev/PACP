# Parallel and Concurrent Programming - Labs


This repository contains lab assignments for CS4533 - Parallel and Concurrent Programming module.

### Lab 1 - Developing Parallel Programs using Pthread library and Comparing the performance of different implementations

#### Task - Implement a Linked List as


1. Serial Program (A standard linked list implementation with no parallelism)
2. Parallel program (based on Pthreads) with one mutex for the entire list
3. Parallel program (based on Pthreads) with read-write locks for the entire linked list
